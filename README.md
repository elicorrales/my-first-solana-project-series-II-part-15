### This project is part of a series and includes a video.

See [Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/blockchain-tutorials/blob/main/README.md) for the overall document that

## In this video we learn 
- to work more with the solana cli:
  - create accounts 
  - airdrop funds
  - get account details

- saw why we would use SystemProgram to create an account with space
